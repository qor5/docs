~.VSlot("{ locals, form }").Init("{ myMenuShow: false }").FormInit(JSONString(fv))~ used to initialize the variables of ~web.Scope~.
~locals~ corresponds to the ~Init~ method and ~form~ corresponds to the ~FormInit~ method.

~.Init~ will initialize ~locals.myMenuShow~ to ~false~. So that you don't need to modify javascript code to do
the initialization. It's often useful to control dialog, popups. At this example,
We add it, So that the cancel button on the menu, could actually close the menu without
requesting server backend.

~toggleFavored~ event func did an partial update only to the favorite icon button. So that it won't close the
menu popup, but updated the button to toggle the favorite icon.
